# Trello_quora
In this project, we have developed REST API endpoints of various functionalities required for a website (similar to Quora) from scratch. In order to observe the functionality of the endpoints, we are using the Swagger user interface and store the data in the PostgreSQL database. Also, the project has to be implemented using Java Persistence API (JPA).
